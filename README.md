# chestnut-burr-detection-from-drone

Pipeline for estimating chestnut tree burr yield from drone imagery.

---

## Overview

This repository implements an end-to-end pipeline for estimating chestnut (*Castanea* spp.) burr yield at the individual-tree level using drone imagery and YOLO object detection. The workflow proceeds from raw flight data to per-tree burr counts through four sequential modules:

1. **Flight Reconstruction** — process raw drone images into georeferenced 3D products (DSM, DTM, CHM, orthomosaic) using Agisoft Metashape
2. **Canopy Segmentation** — delineate individual tree canopies from the Canopy Height Model using marker-controlled watershed segmentation
3. **Image Selection** — back-project each canopy polygon onto the raw drone image collection and select the highest-quality image per tree
4. **Burr Detection** — detect and count burrs in each canopy image using YOLO; includes training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference modes

```

## Hardware Requirements

The full pipeline was developed and tested on Windows with the following hardware:

- **OS:** Windows (Metashape Python API is Windows-only)
- **GPU:** 8 GB VRAM minimum; 16+ GB recommended for Metashape depth map generation and YOLO training
- **RAM:** 128 GB recommended (Metashape depth map generation is memory-intensive; the reconstruction script monitors available RAM and can subdivide tasks automatically)
- **CPU:** 24-core recommended
- **Disk:** ~256 GB free space per orchard dataset (raw images + Metashape project files)

## Step 1: Flight Reconstruction

**Script:** `flight_reconstruction/reconstruction.py`  
**Config:** `flight_reconstruction/config.yml`

### What It Does

Automates Agisoft Metashape to generate georeferenced 3D products from raw drone images:

1. Loads images, computes per-image quality scores, and removes images below threshold (default 0.70)
2. Matches tie points across images, aligns cameras, and optimizes camera intrinsics and extrinsics using RTK/GPS reference coordinates
3. Applies USGS-recommended three-stage tie point filtering: reconstruction uncertainty → projection accuracy → reprojection error (percentile-based thresholds)
4. Builds dense depth maps and a colored, confidence-weighted point cloud
5. Classifies ground points (angle/distance/cell-size thresholds) and generates DSM, DTM, and CHM (DSM − DTM)
6. Produces an orthorectified mosaic with mosaic blending and ghosting filter
7. Exports all products as GeoTIFF/LAS with UTM projection auto-detected from the first image's GPS coordinates

Each processing step checks whether it already completed before running; the pipeline is **resumable** from any point by re-running the same command. GPU selection automatically restricts to devices with ≥8 GB VRAM and disables CPU during GPU-intensive steps to reduce memory fragmentation.

### Inputs

| Input | Path | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Raw images | `<folder>/*.JPG` | DJI Mavic 3M; RTK accuracy read from XMP |
| PPK GNSS files | `<folder>/*.nav`, `*.obs`, `*.bin`, `*.MRK` | DJI PPK navigation |
| Config | `flight_reconstruction/config.yml` | See config reference below |

### Outputs

All written to `<folder>/outputs/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<name>.psx` | Metashape project file (resumable) |
| `<name>_dsm.tif` | Digital Surface Model (GeoTIFF, UTM) |
| `<name>_dtm.tif` | Digital Terrain Model (ground points only) |

### Usage

```powershell
conda activate burr-detection
$env:METASHAPE_LICENSE_KEY="XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"

python -m flight_reconstruction.reconstruction `
    --config "flight_reconstruction/config.yml" `
    --folder "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4"
```

### Key Config Parameters

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `gps.use_rtk` | `true` | Read RTK accuracy from DJI XMP metadata |
| `image_quality.quality_threshold` | `0.70` | Discard images below this Metashape quality score (0–1) |
| `photo_matching.downscale` | `1` | Matching resolution; 1 = full resolution |
| `photo_matching.keypoint_limit` | `80000` | Max keypoints per image |
| `tie_point_filtering.reconstruction_uncertainty.percentile` | `20` | Remove worst 20% by reconstruction uncertainty |

| `classify_ground_points.max_angle` | `15.0` | Maximum slope angle (°) for ground classification |
| `dem.resolution` | `0` | Output raster resolution; `0` = auto from GSD |
| `orthomosaic.blending_mode` | `mosaic` | Blending algorithm for orthomosaic |

### Limitations

- Requires Agisoft Metashape Professional license (proprietary; not open-source)
- Windows-only (Metashape Python API)
- Assumes DJI drone with standard XMP tags for RTK accuracy; other manufacturers use different tag names
- Single-chunk processing; multi-chunk workflows are not automated
- `subdivide_task` is `false` by default in all config sections; enable for datasets that exceed available RAM

---

## Step 2: Canopy Segmentation

**Script:** `canopy_segmentation/segmentation.py`

### What It Does

Segments individual tree canopies from the CHM using **marker-controlled watershed segmentation** with an adaptive proximity penalty:

1. Loads CHM raster and tree marker points (manually digitized from imagery or collected with RTK GNSS)
2. Refines each marker to the local CHM maximum within a buffer radius (corrects imprecise field placement)
3. Constructs a watershed cost surface from: inverted CHM height, CHM gradient magnitude, and a proximity penalty that scales each tree's boundary distance by its height relative to neighboring trees — preventing over-segmentation in dense stands
4. Runs scikit-image watershed with each refined marker as a labeled seed
5. Removes segments smaller than 5 m² and removes any segments that clip the orchard boundary polygon by more than 0.5 m
6. Exports canopy polygons and refined treetop points as shapefiles

### Inputs

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--chm` | CHM GeoTIFF from flight reconstruction |
| `--tree-markers` | Point shapefile of approximate tree locations |
| `--extent` (optional) | Boundary polygon; segments overlapping it by >0.5 m are removed |

### Outputs

Written to `--outdir`:

| File | Attributes |
|------|------------|
| `<name>_Canopies.shp` | `tree_id`, `area_m2`, `max_h` (m), `mean_h` (m) |
| `<name>_Treetops.shp` | `tree_id`, height at refined location |

### Usage

```powershell
conda activate burr-detection

python -m canopy_segmentation.segmentation `
    --chm "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4/outputs/20230823_Orchard4_chm.tif" `
    --tree-markers "canopy_segmentation/sample_data/inputs/20230823_Orchard4_tree_markers.shp" `
    --outdir "canopy_segmentation/sample_data/outputs/" `
    --min-height 1.75 `
    --buffer-size 0.5 `
    --id-column Tree_ID `
    --extent "canopy_segmentation/sample_data/inputs/20230823_Orchard4_boundary.shp"
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--chm` | yes | — | Path to CHM GeoTIFF |
| `--tree-markers` | yes | — | Tree marker point shapefile |
| `--outdir` | yes | — | Output directory |
| `--min-height` | no | `1.75` | Minimum CHM height (m) for the segmentation mask |
| `--buffer-size` | no | `1.0` | Buffer radius (m) for local maxima refinement |
| `--id-column` | no | first non-geometry column | Column name for tree IDs in marker file |
| `--extent` | no | — | Boundary polygon shapefile |

*Tree markers can be manually digitized using leaf-off imagery or collected with an RTK GNSS receiver in the field.*

### Limitations

- One marker = one canopy segment; touching or overlapping crowns are not automatically separated without separate markers
- Pairwise inter-tree distance computation scales O(n²); performance degrades above ~10,000 trees
- CHM and markers must share a coordinate reference system (geopandas will attempt auto-reprojection if they differ)

---

## Step 3: Image Selection

**Script:** `image_selection/canopy_to_image.py`

### What It Does

Selects the highest-quality raw drone image for each canopy polygon using Metashape's calibrated 3D camera model for back-projection:

1. Back-projects each canopy polygon onto all candidate raw images using the Metashape camera model (accounts for lens distortion, orientation, and 3D position)
2. Retains images where the polygon projects within a 10 m distance threshold on the image plane
3. Scores each candidate image:
   - **Exposure:** mean pixel value in projected region; filtered to 0.15–0.85 (discards over/underexposed images)
   - **Gimbal pitch:** read from DJI XMP tag; images near nadir (~−90° ± 5°) are preferred
   - **Sharpness:** variance of the Laplacian over the projected canopy region
   - **Contrast:** standard deviation of pixel values in the projected region
4. Selects the image with highest sharpness (within 85% of the per-canopy maximum), breaking ties by contrast

### Inputs

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--canopy_shapefile` | Canopy polygon shapefile from segmentation |
| `--dsm` | DSM raster (for 3D Z-value assignment during back-projection) |
| `--metashape_project` | Metashape `.psx` project with aligned cameras |
| `--raw_images` | Folder containing raw drone images |
| `--output` | Output directory |

### Output

`best_image_selections.json` — maps each tree ID to its selected image and projected canopy polygon:

```json
{
  "338": {
    "image_path": "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4/DJI_20230823122017_0102_D.JPG",
    "polygon_coords": [[2521.04, 2099.90], [2508.38, 2099.97], ...]
  }
}
```

Polygon coordinates are in **image pixel space** (not geographic coordinates).

### Usage

```powershell
conda activate burr-detection

python -m image_selection.canopy_to_image `
    --canopy_shapefile "canopy_segmentation/sample_data/outputs/20230823_Orchard4_Canopies.shp" `
    --dsm "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4/outputs/20230823_Orchard4_dsm.tif" `
    --metashape_project "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4/outputs/project_20230823_Orchard4.psx" `
    --raw_images "flight_reconstruction/sample_data/20230823_Orchard4" `
    --output "image_selection/sample_data/outputs"
```

### Limitations

- Requires a fully-aligned Metashape project (cameras must already be positioned from Step 1)
- Assumes DJI XMP tags for gimbal pitch; other drone brands use different metadata schemas
- The 10 m image-plane distance threshold may need adjustment for different flight altitudes or focal lengths
- Does not check for occlusion by neighboring trees or branches

## Step 4: Burr Detection

**Entry point:** `burr_detection/detection.py`  
**Config:** `burr_detection/config.yml`

Four modes are available: `preprocess`, `train`, `tune`, and `inference`. All are accessed through the same entry point:

```powershell
conda activate burr-detection

python -m burr_detection.detection `
    --mode <preprocess|train|tune|inference> `
    --config "burr_detection/config.yml" `
    --data-root "<your dataset root>" `   # optional; overrides the sample-data paths
    --plot-mode <all|subset|none>
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--mode` | `inference` | `preprocess`, `train`, `tune`, or `inference` |
| `--config` | `burr_detection/config.yml` | Path to YAML config file (the committed config points at the bundled sample data) |
| `--data-root` | _(none)_ | Point the pipeline at your own dataset *without editing the committed config*; derives the `tiled/`, `full_canopy/`, `outputs/` layout (see below) |
| `--plot-mode` | `subset` | `all` (every image), `subset` (15 random), `none` |

**Typical workflow:** `preprocess` (build or split the tiled training set) → `tune` (search hyperparameters) → copy the best hyperparameters into `training_params` → `train` (final model) → `inference`. No trained weights ship with the sample data (withheld pending publication), so run `preprocess → tune → train` to produce a model; `inference` can then run standalone.

---

### Dataset Format and Preprocessing (`--mode preprocess`)

`--mode preprocess` builds the training set and is the first step before `train`/`tune`. Given
full-resolution per-tree canopy images plus **polygon** (segmentation) burr labels, it:

1. Crops/masks each image to its canopy polygon and tiles it into 224×224 patches (20% overlap),
   clipping burr polygons to each tile and deriving bounding boxes; mostly-background tiles are dropped.
2. De-duplicates overlapping (double-annotated) boxes.
3. Creates a **group-aware** train/val/test split (70/20/10) where all tiles cut from one source tree
   stay in the same split — preventing the tree-level leakage a plain per-tile shuffle would cause.
4. Saves QA overlays so you can confirm labels align with the imagery.

> **Where the data comes from:** Steps 1–3 produce the per-tree canopy *images*, and the canopy polygon comes from segmentation (Step 2) — but the **burr polygon labels are not produced by the pipeline.** You create them by hand-annotating the canopy images (e.g., in Roboflow), since the detector learns from human-drawn labels.

Expected dataset layout (produced by your annotation/export step; pass its root with `--data-root`):

```
<data-root>/
├── full_canopy/
│   ├── images/    # full-resolution per-tree canopy images
│   ├── labels/    # YOLO-segment polygon burr labels (one .txt per image)
│   └── canopy/    # YOLO-segment canopy polygon per image (used for masking)
└── tiled/                           # written by --mode preprocess (the training set)
```

```powershell
python -m burr_detection.detection --mode preprocess `
    --data-root "<data-root>" --plot-mode subset
```

The bundled sample ships ready-to-train tiles in `…/training/tiled/`, plus the source images and
polygon labels in `…/training/full_canopy/` for reference. With the committed config, `--mode
preprocess` only builds the group-aware train/val/test split over those tiles — it does not re-tile.
To tile your own data, pass a `full_canopy/` layout via `--data-root <root>`. The full dataset is
distributed via Google Drive, not committed to git.

You can also chain the whole pipeline in one command — `tune` hands its winning hyperparameters
directly to `train`:

```powershell
python -m burr_detection.detection --mode preprocess,tune,train,inference `
    --data-root "<data-root>" --plot-mode subset
```

---

### 4a. Training Mode

Trains a YOLO model using **multi-step progressive gradient accumulation**, which simulates large effective batch sizes without exceeding GPU memory:

| Step | Layers Unfrozen |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Detection head (predictor) |
| 2 | Full head (neck + predictor) |
| 3 | Head + last ⅓ of backbone |
| 4 | Full model |

Per-step physical batch, gradient accumulation, max-epochs, and patience are set in `config.yml` (`training_steps`); physical batch is capped and accumulation reaches the large effective batches.

The learning rate is scaled per step as `lr = min(lr0, max_lr0) × (effective_batch / 64)^0.5`, capped at `max_scaled_lr`. Progressive unfreezing is **architecture-aware** (read from the model YAML) and re-applied on the live trainer at the start of each step, so the curriculum actually takes effect. The best-epoch optimizer state is **carried across each step boundary** (momentum is preserved through the unfreeze), and the learning rate is **warmed up** over a few epochs at each transition. The best checkpoint across all steps/epochs is selected by a **composite objective** (validation loss + F1 + mAP50) and saved as `best_model_weights.pt`.

```powershell
python -m burr_detection.detection --mode train `
    --config "burr_detection/config.yml" `
    --plot-mode subset
```

**Outputs** — written to `burr_detection/sample_data/training/outputs/training_<timestamp>/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `best_model_weights.pt` | Best checkpoint across all steps (by the composite objective) |
| `training_metrics.csv` | Per-epoch: learning rate, losses, precision, recall, mAP50, F1 |
| `test_results.csv` | Held-out test set: precision, recall, F1, mAP50, inference time |
| `train_step{1-4}/` | Per-step YOLO run directories (weights, results.csv, plots) |
| `prediction_plots/` | Side-by-side ground truth vs. prediction visualizations |

**Performance**

The detector is **YOLOv8/YOLO11** (small & medium); the tuning search explores each model with a baseline (stride-8) and a **P2 (stride-4) head** for small-object detection — see `tuning_space.model_size` in `config.yml`.

> The figures below are from the **prior production model**; metrics will change after re-tuning/training on the current (group-split, augmented) dataset.

*Full dataset (production model)* — YOLOv8s on the held-out test split (174 images, 1,936 burrs), ~3.6 ms/img inference on an RTX 4060 Laptop GPU:

| Precision | Recall | F1 | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
|-----------|--------|----|-------|----------|
| 0.818 | 0.748 | 0.782 | 0.820 | 0.431 |

*The full multi-orchard training set is proprietary and not distributed here.*

*Included sample dataset* — the single-orchard sample is small, so test metrics vary noticeably run-to-run (mAP50 ≈ 0.70–0.80). A representative run:

| Precision | Recall | F1 | mAP50 |
|-----------|--------|----|-------|
| 0.791 | 0.743 | 0.767 | 0.801 |

**Key `training_params` in `config.yml`** (default / tuned starting point):

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `model_size` | `yolov8s.pt` | Base model |
| `imgsz` | `416` | Input image size |
| `optimizer` | `SGD` | — |
| `lr0` | `0.00754` | Initial learning rate |
| `momentum` | `0.861` | SGD momentum |
| `weight_decay` | `0.00800` | — |
| `dropout` | `0.113` | — |
| `mosaic` | `0.047` | Mosaic augmentation probability |

---

### 4b. Tuning Mode

Searches the hyperparameter space using **Ray Tune with Optuna (Bayesian) search** and ASHA early stopping:

- Trial count and concurrency are set in `config.yml` (`ray_tune.num_samples`, `max_concurrent_trials`)
- ASHA scheduler prunes underperforming trials, with a grace window across each progressive-unfreeze step transition so a recovering trial isn't pruned on the transition spike
- Optimization metric (scheduling **and** best-model selection): a **composite objective** = validation loss + (1−F1) + (1−mAP50), chosen so that tuning the box/cls/dfl loss gains does not confound the objective
- NaN/inf losses are replaced with a sentinel value (a degenerate trial is pruned, not crashed)
- The `training_params` entry in the config is used as a warm-start point for Optuna

```powershell
python -m burr_detection.detection --mode tune `
    --config "burr_detection/config.yml" `
    --plot-mode subset
```

**Tuning space** (from `burr_detection/config.yml`):

The search covers `model_size` (the four models × baseline/P2 stride variants), `optimizer`, learning rate (`lr0`/`lrf`), `momentum`, `weight_decay`, the localization loss gains (`box_gain`/`dfl_gain`), and augmentation (`hsv_*`, `degrees`, `scale`, `flipud`). See `tuning_space` in `config.yml` for the exact set and ranges.

**Outputs** — written to `burr_detection/sample_data/training/outputs/tuning_<timestamp>/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `best_<model>_model.pt` | Best model weights |
| `best_trial_config.json` | Hyperparameters for the best trial |
| `all_tuning_history.csv` | Metrics for all trials |
| `best_trial_training_history.csv` | Per-epoch metrics for the best trial |
| `test_results.csv` | Test set evaluation of best model |
| `prediction_plots/` | Prediction visualizations |

Each tuning run also appends one row to `model_registry.csv` at the `outputs/` root — a cross-run index of every winner (run, model, composite objective, key metrics, and paths to its weights + config). Sort by `objective` (lower is better) to find the best run; promotion into `config.yml` (`training_params`) stays a manual copy.

Tuning checkpoints per-epoch to `<trial_dir>/checkpoint_<epoch>/` (model weights + state), allowing trials to resume after interruption. Hyperparameter-importance and top-trial curves (`hp_importance.png`, `top_trial_curves.png`, `trial_summary.csv`) are written to the Ray experiment directory at the end of the run.

### 4c. Inference Mode

Detects burrs on unlabeled canopy images using a tile-and-reconstruct strategy:

For each tree in `best_image_selections.json`:
1. Crop the canopy polygon region from the full drone image (mask outside region to black)
2. Tile the cropped canopy into 224×224 patches with 20% overlap (stride = 179 px); skip all-black tiles
3. Run YOLO inference on the tiles in batches (`inference.tile_batch_size`), confidence threshold 0.5 by default
4. Reconstruct tile-space detections to full canopy coordinates, keeping only detections whose box **center** lies in each tile's non-overlapping **core** region — so a burr in the overlap seam is counted once, not double-counted
5. Apply a light global NMS (`inference.global_nms_iou`, default 0.3) to resolve any residual cross-tile duplicates
6. Aggregate per tree: total detections, average confidence, bounding box coordinates

The model is **auto-detected** from the most recent `training_*/` or `tuning_*/` output directory when `inference.model_path` is `null`. To use a specific model, set `inference.model_path` to an explicit path.

```powershell
python -m burr_detection.detection --mode inference `
    --config "burr_detection/config.yml" `
    --plot-mode subset
```

**Inference config keys:**

```yaml
inference:
  model_path: null          # null = auto-detect most recent training/tuning output
  conf_threshold: 0.5
  iou_threshold: 0.45        # per-tile NMS during predict()
  global_nms_iou: 0.3        # light cross-tile NMS after core-region filtering
  tile_batch_size: 96        # tiles per batched predict() call

data:
  image_selections: image_selection/sample_data/outputs/best_image_selections.json
```

**Outputs** — written to `burr_detection/sample_data/inference/outputs/inference_<timestamp>/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tree_burr_detections.csv` | Per tree: `tree_id`, `image_path`, `total_detections`, `avg_confidence`, `detection_coords` |
| `detection_summary.txt` | Summary stats: mean/min/max burrs per tree, overall confidence, model info |
| `preprocessed_trees/` | Cropped canopy images (for visual verification of masking) |
| `prediction_plots/` | Detection visualizations with bounding boxes |

**Sample inference results** from included sample run (`best_yolo11s_model.pt`, conf=0.5, IoU=0.45):

| Trees Processed | Total Detections | Mean Burrs/Tree | Min | Max | Avg Confidence |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| 516 | 71,963 | 139 | 0 | 730 | 0.605 |

## Limitations and Known Assumptions

- **Platform:** Windows-only due to the Agisoft Metashape Python API (Steps 1 and 3)
- **Drone hardware:** Optimized for DJI Mavic 3M; RTK accuracy parsing and gimbal pitch metadata both depend on DJI-specific XMP tags
- **Single class:** The detector is configured for one object class (burr); multi-class use requires label and config changes
- **Canopy segmentation:** One-to-one mapping between markers and canopies; touching or overlapping crowns are not automatically split without separate markers per crown and, as such, outputs usually require manual cleanup. ## TODO: instance segmentation from point cloud
- **Image selection:** Does not account for occlusion of a canopy by adjacent trees or branches
- **Tiling:** Tile size (224×224) and overlap (20%) match across preprocessing and inference; both are configurable via the `data.tiling` and `inference` keys in `config.yml`
- **Metashape license:** Agisoft Metashape Professional is required for Steps 1 and 3; the included wheel is version 2.2.2
